                            a result to the user. The data analysis technique used for this tool is logistic regression. An interpretation of the probability is also provided to the user. This interpretation allows for a quick and easy understanding of
                            the results.

                            looking at the relationship between the grey line and the red line. Near the lower end of the graph (Left Side), the red line roughly follows the grey line in elevation changes. As the average glucose level increases the red
                            line slowly deviates from the grey line revealing a connection between high average glucose levels and the number of people who have had a stroke. A simple way to interpret this chart is to conclude that having a high average
                            glucose level leads to a higher chance of experiencing a stroke.
